Let’s compare the **original approach** (hardcoded course data) vs. the **new dynamic API fetching approach**, side-by-side.

## ⚔️ Comparison: Hardcoded Props vs. Dynamic API Fetching

| Category                  | Original Approach (Static)                 | New Approach (Dynamic)                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧱 Data Location          | Hardcoded directly in `page.tsx` via props | Stored in MongoDB, fetched via API                     |
| 🔁 Updating Courses       | Requires editing the code and redeploying  | Just update the DB — no code changes needed            |
| 🔌 Data Reusability       | Only usable on that one page               | Can be reused in other routes, APIs, mobile apps, etc. |
| ⚙️ Scalability            | Breaks down fast with lots of courses      | Easily supports 100s or 1000s of entries               |
| 📤 Separation of Concerns | UI + data are tightly coupled              | UI is separated from data logic (clean architecture)   |
| 📱 Real-World Practice    | Toy example                                | Real-world, industry-standard backend integration      |
| 🔎 Search / Filter Ready? | Not easily                                 | ✅ Easily add filtering, search, pagination, etc.       |
| 🌐 Deployment Ready?      | Kinda                                      | ✅ Fully production-grade approach                      |
| 💼 Resume Appeal          | Shows React knowledge                      | ✅ Shows full-stack architecture + data flow skills     |
| 🧪 Testability            | Harder to mock/test                        | ✅ You can mock API responses in Jest tests             |
| 🔥 Coolness Factor        | Low                                        | ✅ Makes you feel like a backend wizard                 |

## 🧠 Why the Dynamic API Approach Wins

This isn’t just “fancier” — it’s **architecturally correct**.

You’re treating your application like a real system:

* The database is the **source of truth**
* The API is the **layer of access**
* The frontend is the **presentation and interaction layer**

That separation lets you grow:

* Add mobile apps
* Add admin dashboards
* Let users post reviews
* Add search, filters, or pagination

All without rewriting the frontend.

## 🔄 Analogy

Imagine running a bookstore.

* **Static**: You hand-write every book listing on a poster. Want to update a price? Rewrite the poster.
* **Dynamic**: You store all books in a database and print custom receipts on demand. Update the DB once, and everything reflects it.

You’re moving from posters to a database-backed storefront — and that’s a major level-up.
